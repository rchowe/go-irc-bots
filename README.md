Go IRC Bots
===========

IRC Bots written in Google Go
-----------------------------

This is exactly what it sounds like. Project for CS 195 (tech talks) at UVM. To start using the bot, do

```bash
$ go run main.go irc.foonetic.net:6667 [nick] [channel]
```

Don't forget to escape the `#` in the prompt for the channel.
